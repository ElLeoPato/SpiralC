# SpiralC
[README em PortuguÃªs](https://github.com/ElLowLeo/SpiralC/blob/main/READMEpt.md)

This repository is about much more than a spiral generating project in C.

Examine the [spiral.c](https://github.com/ElLowLeo/SpiralC/blob/main/spiral.c) file to see how the code is structured.

That's exactly what it's about, I made this code with 9 principles in mind, which I will try to follow from now on, to achieve good code in C

## The 9 principles of good code in C
- **Readability**
- **Modularity**
- **Comments (but not so many, or none at all)**
- **Use of Constants (but not so many)**
- **Memory Management**
- **Error Handling**
- **Efficiency**
- **Optimization**
- **Clear Purpose**

And yes, this code follows all of these standards.

## Is it easy to follow all these principles?
It all depends. Probably, but here's the question: Will I absolutely follow all of these concepts in all of my codes?

**Not all of them.**
